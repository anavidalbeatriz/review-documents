# Document Review System

A Python-based system that analyzes and reviews documents based on a set of customizable rules. This system uses the Gemini LLM model via LangChain for more advanced reviews, including clarity and cohesion checks.

## Features

- **Rule-based Document Review**: Supports static length checks and LLM-based checks for different categories such as clarity, cohesion, etc.
- **Extensibility**: Add and modify rules via a JSON file.
- **Easy Integration**: Works with Google Gemini LLM via LangChain for powerful text analysis.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Sensitive data like API keys are loaded from a `.env` file for better security.
